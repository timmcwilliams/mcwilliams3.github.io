<h2>About Me</h2>
 
<div class="container">
<section id="main-bio"> 

      <p><img id="bio-image" src="assets/images/head shot tim.jpg" alt="Tim McWilliams">Houston Native - Married for 40 Years - 1 daughter, 1 son, 1 Grandson and we adopted son that was 7 and is now 10. Always worked in the oilfield specific to chemicals. Worked at one company for 20 years and then moved because thougth it was a good idea to do something else which ended up being a very good idea. 
      <br>
      Since then have joined 2 other chemical companies and built and started another chemco using a public companies money (that was fun). Since all that my career has turned a bit - running a chemical trading company that is online based "GoChem.co" (not ".com"). Now own a Kona Ice Food Truck business, raising the kids, helping the community rebuild after the storm and playing golf and flying airplanes. 
      BTW - Still play guitar, fly (anything with wings - especially the ones that can do loops and rolls!!), hunt and fish and "work" at other "hobbies". 
      <br>
      Looking forward to using this skillset to use applications to assist and create value added segment to companies and mine and my families lives. 
      <br>
      Lessons Learned: Don't take things personally, always be positive, dream big, face your fears and stay close to your family.
      I am here to find a new way to derive income from either direct application of skills or by management of proects that enhance business and marketing ideas. Planes and golf are expensive!
